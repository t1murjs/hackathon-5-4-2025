# Course Rating System Web App

## Overview

This Course Rating System Web App is designed to allow students to rate and review courses they have taken. It provides a platform for students to share their feedback on various aspects of the course, such as content quality, teaching style, resources, and overall experience. This app is aimed at helping future students make informed decisions about the courses they choose and providing instructors with constructive feedback to improve their teaching.

The system includes both a frontend and backend to manage courses, ratings, and user accounts, with a focus on simplicity and usability.

This project is built on the TRES Hackathon in 5th April 2025.
